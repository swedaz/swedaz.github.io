         <h2>A Short Biography</h2>
           <p1>My name is Swetha Mohandas. I am a rising junior at Inglemoor High School. I live in Bothell with my mom, dad, and my younger
             sister. Her name is Riya and she is going to 6th grade in Northshore Junior High. I love to play tennis, dance, spend time with my
             family and friends, and I like to watch Netflix. DECA is also one of my interest and I have a lot of fun being part of that club
             in my school. Coding has always interested me and I'm glad to be part of Girls Who Code this summer and learn more about it!</p1>
